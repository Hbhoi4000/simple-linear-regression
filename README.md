**Simple Linear Regression**
Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.

**Problem Statement example for Simple Linear Regression:\n
**
Here we are taking a dataset that has two variables: Height (dependent variable) and weight (Independent variable). The goals of this problem is:

We want to find out if there is any correlation between these two variables\n
We will find the best fit line for the dataset.\n
How the dependent variable is changing by changing the independent variable.\n


Step-1: Data Pre-processing \n
Step-2: Fitting the Simple Linear Regression to the Training Set:\n
Step: 3. Prediction of test set result:\n
Step: 4. visualizing the Training set results:\n
Step: 5. visualizing the Test set results:\n
Step 6: checking different error MAE,MSE,RMSE\n
